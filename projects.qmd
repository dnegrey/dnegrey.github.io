## Shiny

I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) was first introduced years ago, I knew that
it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on
learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all
while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew
much more comfortable with Shiny, learning more advanced topics while also
strengthening my R programming skills, becoming more familiar with data
visualization packages and improving my software development abilities. Check
out some of the apps I have built, hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/):

### NFL Weekly Picks

In 2019, I built an app to track my family's weekly picks for the NFL regular
season. This app won me a spot on the [System76 Superfan 3: Mission to
Thelio](https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio)
(my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an
[experience](https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1) that I will never forget)! Be sure
to check out [System76](https://system76.com/) if you're not already familiar -
they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing tech! It has
been years since that contest and the weekly football picks continues to thrive,
now including extended family and friends and a much better UI!
