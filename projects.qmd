## Shiny

I love bringing data to life through interactive web applications! When
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) was first introduced years ago, I knew that
it would become indispensable in my toolkit. I spent a lot of time early on
learning the basics and trying my best to understand reactive programming, all
while being fairly new to the principles of web development. Over time, I grew
much more comfortable with Shiny, learning more advanced topics while also
strengthening my R programming skills, becoming more familiar with data
visualization packages and improving my software development abilities. Check
out some of the apps I have built, hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/):

### NFL Weekly Picks

In 2019, I built an app to track my family's weekly picks for the NFL regular
season. This app won me a spot on the [System76 Superfan 3: Mission to
Thelio](https://blog.system76.com/post/188835953849/winners-of-superfan-3-mission-to-thelio)
(my proudest moment as an open-source data geek and an
[experience](https://t.co/Cz50iQLTi6?amp=1) that I will never forget)! Be sure
to check out [System76](https://system76.com/) if you're not already familiar -
they are an awesome company, with great people, building amazing tech! It has
been years since that contest and the weekly football picks continues to thrive,
now including extended family and friends and a much better UI!

## Professional development

**[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**

I am an advocate for massive open online courses
([MOOCs](https://www.mooc.org/)), and in particular, I have had great
experiences with Coursera. Below are some of the courses I've taken and projects
I've completed as part of those courses. This training was instrumental in
helping me learn R, Shiny and the fundamentals of reproducible data science.

**[SAS Global Certification](https://www.sas.com/en_us/certification.html)**

Growth in the early part of my career was heavily dependent on learning the SAS
programming language. Besides career advancement, though, I was very intrigued
by making analytic processes more efficient - both in terms of reducing the time
required for jobs to run as well as consolidating the code bases to be more
concise. For each of these areas, mastering the SAS macro and SQL pass-through
facilities was critical, and it started me down a path of data science software
engineering that has persisted throughout my career and is a key component of my
professional approach.

**[MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)**

Some of the most eye-opening moments in my career have come while learning
about paradigm shifting technology. Indeed, this was the case when I was first
introduced to NoSQL databases like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and
[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/). Each offers a community version of their product
and a wealth of free training opportunities.

#### Other articles and presentations

**[Data Days CLE](https://www.datadayscle.org/)**

I was very fortunate to be invited to speak at the inaugural Data Days Cleveland
conference in 2017. Data Days CLE is the regionâ€™s only conference focused on
accessible data and civic technology for community impact. I gave a
<a href="https://dnegrey.com/dataDaysCLE/main.html" target="_blank">presentation introducing R</a>
and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ls7WpDdzV18" target="_blank">spoke to attendees</a>
about how open-source data science tools like R have become critical for data
accessibility and community impact.

**[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dnegrey/)**

You're never too old to revisit the basics! This is an
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/describing-your-data-understanding-distributions-dan-negrey" target="_blank">article I wrote back in 2015</a>
that illustrates the fundamentals of using data distributions and summary
statistics.
