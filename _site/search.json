Currently, I am the Director of Analytics at MarketBridge, where I am fortunate to work with so many bright and motivated colleagues as we help clients solve some of their most pressing challenges. My career has centered around marketing analytics but I am genuinely interested in all things data, especially when it involves the use of open-source technology. In particular, I love using R with Shiny and R Markdown to build powerful data tools, dashboards and reports."
