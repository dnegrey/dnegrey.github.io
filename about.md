I am currently the Director of Analytics and Data Science with [Precision Dialogue](http://www.precisiondialogue.com). I have been with the company since July 2009. My academic background includes a B.S.Ed. in Integrated Mathematics Education and an M.S. in Mathematics, both from [Ohio University](http://www.ohiou.edu). Prior to joining PD, I held analytic roles at [National City Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_City_Corp) and [American Greetings](http://www.americangreetings.com). My professional interests include statistical computing, data visualization, predictive modeling and reproducible research.
