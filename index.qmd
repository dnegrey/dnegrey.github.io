Hello, world! I am a data scientist based in Cleveland, OH. My current role is
Director of Analytics at [MarketBridge](https://market-bridge.com/), where
I am fortunate to work with so many bright and motivated colleagues as we help
clients solve some of their most pressing data science challenges. My
career has centered around marketing analytics but I am genuinely interested in
all things data, especially when it involves the use of open-source technology.
In particular, I love using R with Shiny and R Markdown to build powerful data
tools, dashboards and reports.
