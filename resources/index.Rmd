### Reading list

I highly recommend each of the following books for anyone interested in data science. These have been (and continue to be) tremendously helpful for me! A great one to start with is *The Linux Command Line*. So much of what I do is dependent on (or enchanced, or made A LOT easier by) working from a Unix-like command line. Shotts does a great job of explaining fundamental and advanced topics both clearly and concisely.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("reading_list.R")
reading_list("reading_list.txt")
```
