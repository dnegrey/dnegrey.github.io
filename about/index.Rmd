### Fun fact

I botched one of my earliest attempts at predicting outcomes when, in the spring of 1991, I bet my brother that Joel Skinner, not Sandy Alomar, would be the Indians starting catcher for the next several years. The Tribe went 57-105 that year with Skinner behind the dish, while the rest of the 90s belonged to Alomar and some great Cleveland baseball teams.
